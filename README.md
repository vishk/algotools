# Algotools

A collection of widely-applicable graph and other problem solving algorithms.

These algorithms can be used to solve some cool problems such as navigating a Maze (with the pathfinding-astar algorithm) or finding how similar a pair of words are in terms of the number of operations needed to convert one to another (via the lev-dist function employing dynamic programming).

The graph algorithms include those that work with both unweighted and weighted graphs (where edge-costs are provided) as well as directed and undirected graphs, such as Breadth-First and Depth-First Searches, Shortest-path (Dijkstra), Minimum Spanning Trees, Pathfinding (A*) etc.

In contrast with these algorithms in other programming languages, graphs that are usable by the functions in this namespace can be in flexible and 'natural' formats.  Most functions in this namespace work with 'Adjacency-list' graphs that are simply mapping of vertices to sequences of neighbors i.e. a graph like this:  
   {:c (:b), :f (:g), :d (:e), :a (:b), :b (), :g (), :e ()}  

or a weighted adjacency-graph such as  

   {:c '([:b 1] [:e 2]), :d '([:e 1]), :a '([:b 2] [:d 1]), :b '([:d 5]), :e '([:b 3]])}  

   At the same time, one could start from as natural a format for unweighted graphs as just a sequences of edges (optionally accompanied by a set of vertices if some vertices are not connected). These edge-lists could be converted to the adjacency graph format or vice-versa using conversion-functions provided.

Create an unweighted directed graph (true => directed):  

    (make-adjlist-graph [[:c :b] [:f :g] [:d :e] [:a :b]] true )
    => {:c (:b), :f (:g), :d (:e), :a (:b), :b (), :g (), :e ()}

Get edges from an unweighted graph:  

    (get-edge-graph {:g '(:f :e), :c '(:b :e), :f '(:g :e :d)}  false)

                        false)
    => {[:g :d] 7, [:f :g] 3, [:d :e] 2, [:a :c] 1, [:b :g] 5, [:a :b] 4, [:f :e] 1, [:c :e] 3, [:a :d] 5}

    => 8

### Other  
Given a graph of precedences, determine traversal-order to resolve dependencies:  

    ;Dependencies:-  :c must go before :b and :e, :f before :g, and so on.
    (def g {:c '(:b :e), :f '(:g), :d '(:e :f), :a '(:b :d), :b '(:d :e), :e '(:g) :g '()})
